The falling Obstacles are created at Random and hurts the player

after given time, player can shoot horizontally and vertically once for a small duration like a lazer
during Lazer Shoot, all hit Objects are disabled, player is invincible
after lazer shoot, player is again vunerable

idea is to create an event when a falling Object is Destroyed (hits the player)
	health bar should reduce
	a animation on panel having red border should appear and fade slowly
	his recharged shoot timer should reset(meaning he again needs to wait a long time before he can fire)
	etc.
